## IntersectionNorms

The aim of this project is to provides tools to compute intersection norms on orientable 2-manifold without boundaries.

** WARNING: This project is at a (very) early development stage and is not functional. **

## Built with

* [BigRational.js](https://github.com/peterolson/BigRational.js/blob/master/README.md) - *BigRational.js* is an arbitrary-length rational number library for Javascript, allowing arithmetic operations on rational numbers of unlimited size, notwithstanding memory and time limitations.
* [Cytoscape](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js) - Graph theory (network) library for visualisation and analysis : https://js.cytoscape.org
